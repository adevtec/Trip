# Coral Travel Provider

This provider will be implemented when Coral Travel API details become available.

## Known Information from wp-content analysis:
- Coral Travel has travel terms at `/reisitingimused/coral-travel/`
- International travel provider

## TODO:
1. Contact Coral Travel for API access
2. Implement provider based on their API specification
3. Add authentication and request formatting
4. Map their data format to our standard TravelOffer interface

## Expected files:
- `provider.ts` - Main Coral Travel provider implementation
- `types.ts` - Coral Travel specific types (if needed)
- `config.ts` - Configuration helpers
